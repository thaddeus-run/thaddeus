THE ARCHITECTURE FOR SOURCE CONTROL AFTER GIT

> [!CAUTION]
> Hey, thank you for giving this a look. BUT be careful, we change things daily, things WILL break. Your repos will be lost.
> We are super early in PRE-ALPHA; this is not ready to be globally adopted! There will be bugs, there will be security risks.
> Please try it, test it & report bugs in Issues. Play around with it and give feedback!
> To get started, look at the release tab and see docs/getting-started.md.

behind every change. Merge as policy — proofs, reputation, a standing human
veto — instead of a person reading a diff.
